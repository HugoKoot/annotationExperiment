  "summary": "John initially reported a 'really good week' of diabetes management, claiming to be 'very compliant' with a diet of 'salads and lean protein,' and 'walking every single day.' He stated his morning fasting levels were 'perfect,' consistently between 90 and 100 mg/dL. However, subsequent weeks showed a decline in adherence and an increase in blood glucose levels. He admitted to having a 'small piece of cake' at a party, for which he claimed to take extra insulin, and later confessed to eating 'pizza one night with friends' with 'a bit more carbs.' His morning readings subsequently rose to 185 mg/dL and then 210 mg/dL. John offered various explanations for these elevated readings, including a 'late dinner,' a 'salad,' or a faulty 'meter,' and later claimed to be 'not sure why' despite dietary deviations. His language shifted from overly enthusiastic to vague and disengaged, such as 'diet was okay, I guess' and 'I suppose so.' Overall, John's adherence has decreased significantly, and he exhibits a trend of downplaying non-adherence and deflecting responsibility.",
