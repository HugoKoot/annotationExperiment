  "summary": "Sarah's reported adherence to her diet and activity plan is inconsistent with her blood sugar readings. Initially, she claimed to be doing a \"pretty good job\" with her diet and \"mostly\" sticking to the meal plan. However, when pressed for details about a meal, she became evasive, stating \"It was just a normal sandwich.\" Her physical activity is vaguely described as trying \"to get out when I can.\" Fasting blood sugar readings have consistently escalated from 145-150 to 170-190 over recent days. Despite these elevated numbers, Sarah maintains she has been \"eating my usual meals\" and attributes the rise to a \"stressful week at work,\" claiming stress \"always makes my numbers go up.\" Her lack of specific reporting and the clear upward trend in blood sugar suggest low adherence and a negative momentum in her diabetes management.",

      "excerpt": "Support Bot: Thank you for logging those, Sarah. These numbers are consistently elevated. Last week you said you were doing a 'pretty good job' with your diet and exercise. Does that still feel true?\nSarah: Yeah I mean I thought I was doing ok. It's been a stressful week at work. That always makes my numbers go up.",
      "explanation": "Sarah's claim of 'doing ok' and a 'pretty good job' with diet and exercise is inconsistent with the significant and consistent elevation of her fasting blood sugar readings (185, 170, 190), indicating a discrepancy between reported adherence and objective outcomes."

      "explanation": "Sarah uses evasive language by claiming to be 'busy' and providing a sweeping generality ('just a normal sandwich') to avoid specific details about her meal, which suggests hiding non-adherence (severity: high)."

      "explanation": "Sarah quickly dismisses any potential dietary or activity contributions to her elevated blood sugar by saying 'Not really' and simply asserting she's been 'eating my usual meals,' which may be an attempt to deflect responsibility and avoid admitting to non-adherence."
