  "summary": "John is currently struggling significantly with managing his diabetes, exhibiting consistently elevated glucose levels (fasting 180, 165 mg/dL; post-dinner 220 mg/dL). His dietary adherence is low, marked by off-plan meals like pizza with regular soda, large portions of pasta, and frequent pre-bed snacks such as crackers or cereal. While he reports taking insulin, he acknowledged it was insufficient for his off-plan pizza, suggesting issues with carbohydrate counting or dosing. John's physical activity is minimal; he reports not exercising much due to fatigue and lack of motivation, often unable to bring himself to walk on most days. He demonstrates self-awareness by connecting his snack choices to higher morning readings and identifying carb counting and portion size estimation as major challenges, especially when eating out. Despite this awareness, his current trends indicate poor glucose control and low adherence across diet and exercise. He is receptive to guidance on portion control and healthier snack alternatives.",
