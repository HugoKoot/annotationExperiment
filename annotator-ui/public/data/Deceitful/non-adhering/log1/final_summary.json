  "summary": "John initially reported high adherence to his diabetes management plan, including a strict diet (salads, lean protein) and daily exercise, claiming \"perfect\" morning fasting blood glucose levels consistently between 90-100 mg/dL. Over subsequent weeks, however, his adherence declined, and his morning fasting readings significantly increased, first to 185 mg/dL and then to 210 mg/dL. John admitted to consuming a piece of cake (for which he stated he took extra insulin but didn't check post-meal levels) and later eating pizza. As his blood glucose levels rose, his explanations became increasingly vague and shifting, from attributing high readings to a \"late salad dinner\" or blaming a \"faulty meter\" to simply being \"not sure why.\" His self-reported dietary adherence also became less enthusiastic (\"diet was okay, I guess,\" \"a bit more carbs\"), and he showed reduced engagement when offered advice. Overall, John demonstrated a clear pattern of decreasing adherence, inconsistent reporting, externalization of blame, and a general trend of downplaying non-adherence and deflecting responsibility.",
