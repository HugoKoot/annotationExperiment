  "summary": "Sarah reports general adherence to her diet, stating it's been \"fine\" and she's been doing a \"pretty good job,\" though she avoids specifics when prompted. She vaguely mentions trying to \"get out when I can\" for physical activity. Her fasting blood sugar readings have shown a concerning upward trend, rising from 145-150 in the first week to consistently elevated levels of 170-190 in the second. When pressed for details on her diet, she provided general descriptions like a \"normal sandwich\" and became evasive, citing being busy. Sarah frequently attributes her high blood sugar readings to stress, stating it \"always makes my numbers go up,\" despite her self-reported efforts. There is a clear discrepancy between her perceived adherence and her objective blood sugar data. Overall, her adherence appears low, with negative momentum in managing her diabetes and signs of disengagement.",

      "explanation": "Sarah's self-assessment of 'doing a pretty good job' with diet and exercise last week is inconsistent with her current consistently elevated blood sugar readings (185, 170, 190) and her subsequent blaming of stress as the sole factor."

      "explanation": "Sarah uses general and non-committal phrases like 'fine,' 'trying,' and 'mostly, yeah' without providing specific details about her diet or adherence to the meal plan, indicating low-medium concreteness (severity: medium)."

      "explanation": "Sarah attributes her consistently elevated blood sugar readings primarily to stress, using the sweeping generalization 'That always makes my numbers go up' to explain away poor numbers rather than acknowledging potential non-adherence to diet or activity. This indicates an attempt to deflect responsibility and game the system."
