  "summary": "The patient, John, reported two elevated glucose readings: 185 mg/dL fasting and 210 mg/dL before bed, indicating poor glycemic control. He candidly admitted to significant dietary non-adherence, including consuming cake and pizza at a party and struggling to get back on track. John also acknowledged misjudging carbohydrate intake for pasta, leading to insufficient insulin dosing and confusion with less frequent meals. His exercise routine is largely neglected; he managed only one 30-minute walk this week despite a daily target, attributing this to work and family fatigue. John shows some willingness to adapt, considering breaking his walks into shorter segments and walking during lunch. He also expressed openness to discussing carb counting challenges with a doctor or dietitian. Overall, John's adherence is currently low, marked by significant dietary and exercise lapses and medication management issues for specific foods. While momentum is poor, his self-awareness and openness to future adjustments offer a slim positive outlook.",

      "explanation": "The phrase 'I sometimes get confused' is a hedge, and 'things I don't have often' is vague, lacking specific examples or quantities of problematic meals, reducing concreteness about the frequency or types of issues. Severity: medium."

      "explanation": "The patient's candid admission of dietary non-adherence and subsequent difficulty getting back on track demonstrates a lack of 'gaming the system' through flawless or deceptive self-reporting. This instance shows honest self-reporting rather than an attempt to appear perfectly compliant."
