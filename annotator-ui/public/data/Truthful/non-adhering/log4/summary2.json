  "summary": "John's recent blood glucose readings reveal elevated levels, with a fasting measurement of 185 mg/dL and a pre-bedtime reading of 210 mg/dL. He has struggled significantly with dietary adherence, admitting to eating cake and pizza at a birthday party and subsequently failing to 'get back on track.' John also reported difficulty with accurate carb counting and insulin dosing for unfamiliar foods like pasta, contributing to high post-meal sugars. His exercise routine is largely non-adherent; despite being prescribed daily 30-minute walks, he has only completed one this week, citing fatigue and a busy schedule. John expressed frustration over his lack of physical activity. While he considered the suggestion of shorter, more frequent walks, his commitment was tentative. Overall, John is experiencing notable challenges across diet, medication adjustment, and exercise, leading to poor glycemic control. His candor suggests an awareness of his non-adherence, indicating a need for more practical strategies and potential re-education.",
